# 🌍 Simple Travel Website

This is my mini project where I designed a **static HTML-based Travel Website**. The goal of this project was to practice basic **HTML elements, formatting, lists, tables, hyperlinks, and images**, while creating something useful like a simple website where people can explore travel destinations and packages.

## 📌 Why I Made This Project

I created this project as a part of my web development learning journey in college. I wanted to explore how to structure a website using only **HTML (without CSS/JS)** and learn:

* How to link multiple webpages together.
* How to use images, tables, lists, and hyperlinks properly.
* How to organize content like travel destinations, packages, and contact info.
* How to build a simple but complete website project.
